- Fun fact: a team of computer scientists,found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer.
- This insect caused the computer to malfunction, and they literally “debugged” the machine by removing it! Since then,
- the term “bug” has been used to describe glitches or errors in software.
